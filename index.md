## Introduction

Hello everyone! I'm Martina, an Italian Exchange Student at the University 
of Helsinki. I am currently attending following the Language Technology 
track in the Master degree in Liguistic Diversity and Digital Humanities. 
Besides university, I love travelling, spending time in nature and 
cooking. I try to be as active as possible also: I do weightlifting and 
yoga. I am always curious to learn new things!
